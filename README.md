# twitter_scraper
This is a collection of modules that work together to pull data from Twitter.

As I make changes to make the scraper more robust, I will add to the repository, but this is a great first step.

Prequisites
-----------

- Python 3.7

- Various libraries to import

Explanation of files
--------
For this to work, there is not much you need to do. So, I will first walk you through the necessary steps to get the program working and pulling data from Twitter, and then I will go through a little more in-depth explanations of the various modules.

To get the files running you must:
    
    1. Create an App on the Twitter Developer's site: https://developer.twitter.com/
    2. Once you have this done, click on 'Details', and then 'Keys and Tokens'
    3. Copy and pase the Consumer key, Consumer secret, Access Token key, Access Token secret (you may have to fist generate access tokens) into `hidden.py`. This is the authorization step that will allow you to access web data through your Twitter account.
