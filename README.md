# twitter_scraper
This is a collection of modules that work together to pull data from Twitter.

As I make changes to make the scraper more robust, I will add to the repository, but this is a great first step.

Prequisites
-----------

- Python 3.7

- Various libraries to import

Explanation of files
--------
For this to work, there is not much you need to do. So, I will first walk you through the necessary steps to get the program working and pulling data from Twitter, and then I will go through a little more in-depth explanations of the various modules.

To get the files running you must:
    
    1. Create an App on the Twitter Developer's site: https://developer.twitter.com/
    2. Once you have this done, click on 'Details', and then 'Keys and Tokens'
